# Unity Timeline Playables Collection

Custom Playables and Markers for Unity Timeline from multiple sources Unite Talks etc.
These are from a range of sources, asset store, github, google drive links. 
I think they're all kind of "Official" Unity releases in so mucha s they're written by Unity employees.
I've gathered them together here because only the DefaultPlayables is easily accessed the rest are hidden around the ecosystem.
A couple of these are from 2017, so quite old and some of the solutions are now obsolete in 2019.4+ with markers and signals.

### Note: this is the state of play(ables) Jan 2022.

LipSync Timeline is my reimplementation of Rhubarb timeline, for texture switching and morph shape blending, I know its a little rough around the edges, but is functinal and can handle building a timeline from a Rhubarb XML output
